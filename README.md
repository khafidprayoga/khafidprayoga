Hi There! 👋  
I’m Khafid Prayoga, a software developer with a few years of experience in the tech world.

I started my journey as a backend developer for about two years, working with APIs, databases, and server-side logic. After that, I moved into frontend development for around a year, where I learned how important good UI and smooth user experience really are. Seeing users enjoy what I build is honestly very satisfying.

Right now, I’m also studying for a Bachelor’s degree in Information Systems while working professionally. Balancing work and college isn’t always easy, but it’s worth it. I like how I can directly apply what I learn in class to real projects—it makes learning feel more real and useful.

Recently, I’ve been exploring web3 and blockchain. I enjoy experimenting with dApps, learning about smart contracts, and understanding how decentralized technology can shape the future of the web. Mixing frontend skills with web3 has been a fun challenge, especially when trying to make decentralized apps easy and pleasant to use.

I’m open to collaboration, especially for hackathons. If you’re working on something interesting in web3 or have an idea you want to build together, feel free to reach out. I believe building things with others is one of the best ways to learn and grow.
